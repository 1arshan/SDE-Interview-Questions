<b name="coding">Coding round questions</b><br/>
- Given a tuple for eg.(a,b,c) Output:  (*, *, *), (*, *, c), (*, b, *), (*, b, c), (a, *, *), (a, *, c), (a, b, *), (a, b, c) 
- Convert infix expression into postfix
- Write code that walks through all source code starting from a root directory and create a histogram of the number of characters per line across all files.
- "Critique" a snippet of code pasted on collabedit.
- Given an array with all elements sorted on each individual row and column find the K-th smallest one.
- Implement a hast table.
- How many sentences: Given an array of words and an array of sentences, determine which words are anagrams of each other.
Calculate how many sentences can be created by replacing any word with one of its anagrams. Eg. wordSet = ['listen', 'silent', 'it', 'is'], sentence = 'listen it is silent', output = 4 (listen and silent are anagrams, possibilities = 2*2=4)
- Conference Schedule: A schedule has just been released for an upcoming tech conference. The schedule provides the start and end times of each of the presentations. Once a presentation has begun, no one can enter or leave the room. It takes no time to go from one presentation to another.
  Determine the maximum number of presentations that can be attended by one person. Eg. n=3, scheduleStart = [1, 1, 2], scheduleStart = [3, 2, 4], output = 2 (attend 1-2 and 2-4).
- String Reduction: Given a string, reduce it in such a way that all of its substrings are distinct. To do so, you may delete any characters at any index.
  What is the minimum number of deletions needed? Eg. s = "abab", output = 2.
- Array Game: Given an array of integers, determine the number of moves to make all elements equal. 
  Each move consists of choosing all but 1 element and incrementing their values by 1. Eg. numbers = [3, 4, 6, 6, 3], output = 7
